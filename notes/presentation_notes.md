# Notes for the Presentation

## General Notes:
- The dates of the correlations and those from the line plots did not match.

## Nr. 6:
- [x] Correct spelling: "Outlier" instead of "Outler."

## Nr. 7:
- [x] Correct spelling: "Outlier" instead of "Outler."

## Nr. 13:
- Comparison of model sea level (SLA) and observed sea level (SLEV).

## Nr. 17:
- Wind direction changes to the south during the event.

## Nr. 20:
- Wind direction shifts to the south.
- Increase in wind speed and water velocity.
- Low air pressure observed.

## Nr. 23:
- Wind direction shifts to the south.
- Increase in wind and water velocity.
- Low air pressure observed.

> Note: The selected data window might be too small, as there is insufficient information about air pressure in the west.

## Nr. 26:
- Wind direction shifts to the west.
- Increase in wind speed.
- Strong winds from the east side.
- Relatively high air pressure during the event.

## Nr. 29:
- Wind direction shifts to the south.
- Strong wind speeds observed during the event.

## Nr. 32:
- Storm surge in Flensburg occurred after a storm in the northeast. This might be due to water sloshing back, with winds now shifting westward but remaining relatively weak.

## Nr. 38:
- Headline: "All Storm Surges from Observations."

## Nr. 40:
- Strong correlations between SLEV and SLA can be observed three days before and after storm surges.
- Weak correlations are noted towards the North Sea.
- Strong negative correlations are observed in the northeast.

## Nr. 41:
- During the events, an increase in wind speed can be observed for all storm surges.
- However, this does not apply to the storm surge from 06.10.2023 to 09.10.2023, where increased wind speed was observed immediately before the event.

## Nr. 42:
- Strong correlations can be observed around Flensburg during all storm surges.
- The exception is the event on 04.10.2023, where a negative correlation is observed during the same period.

## Nr. 43:
- For all storm surges, it can be observed that the wind came from the east.
- This does not apply to the storm surge from 06.10.2023 to 09.10.2023, where the wind direction was from the west during the event. Other factors likely caused this storm surge.

## Nr. 44:
- Negative correlations can be observed in the Baltic Sea during storm surges.
- However, the correlation is weaker for the storm surge from 04.10.2023 to 10.10.2023.

## Nr. 45:
- In all storm surges, it can be observed that the water moves westward.

## Nr. 46:
- [No information provided.]

## Nr. 47:
- It can be observed that during or immediately before all storm surges, there was a drop in air pressure.

## Nr. 48:
- The correlations indicate that during the storm surges...

## Nr. 51:
- It can be observed that before or during the storm surge, the water direction was negative.
